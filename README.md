Create tougher, more durable equipment. It's _unlikely_ this mod will conflict with other mods or cause issues due to simplicity.


## Requirements

- Java >= 8
- Minecraft 1.15.2
- Fabric Loader >= 0.11.7
- Fabric API

[Java 8](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) is highly recommended because both [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) 1.15.2 and this mod are developed with it, but newer versions of Java are _likely_ to work. You should install the latest stable version of [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).


## Installation

Download the `steel-x.x.x.jar` file from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/realguyman/steel/releases) and drop it into your Minecraft mods folder.
