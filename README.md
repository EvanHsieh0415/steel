# Steel

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/realguyman/steel/total)

Create tougher, more durable equipment. Take note that it's _unlikely_ this mod will conflict with other mods or otherwise cause issues.

## Features

- Steel can be crafted from cooking iron nuggets, ingots, or blocks in a blast furnace (regular furnaces aren't hot enough).
- Steel nuggets, ingots, and armor can be found in treasure chests throughout your world.
- Villager armorers, toolsmiths, and weaponsmiths can buy steel nuggets and ingots from you.
- Armorers can sell you steel armor as well.
- A decorative steel block.

## Requirements

- Java >= 8
- Minecraft 1.15.2
- Fabric Loader >= 0.11.7
- Fabric API

Although [Java 8](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) is highly recommended, this mod should work with newer versions. You should install the latest stable version of [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Installation

Download the appropriate `steel-*.jar` file from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/realguyman/steel/releases) and drop it into your mods folder.
